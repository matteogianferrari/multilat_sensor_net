# Client Component Requirements

## 1. Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Requirement Title     | Requirement Description                                                                      |
|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SRS-CLIENT-001 | Client Initialization | The client must possess an unique ID.                                                        |
| SRS-CLIENT-002 | Data Output           | The client must allow logging the predicted positions in a CSV format.                       |
| SRS-CLIENT-003 | Network Communication | The client must connect to the distributed network via gRPC for position retrieval requests. |
| SRS-CLIENT-004 | Network Communication | The client must send a start request to the distributed network to activate it.              |
| SRS-CLIENT-005 | Real-Time Tracking    | The client must retrieve the targetâ€™s position at a configurable frequency in Hertz (Hz).    |
| SRS-CLIENT-006 | Real-Time Tracking    | The client must predict the target future position.                                          |


## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Requirement Title | Requirement Description                                                                    |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SRS-CLIENT-007 | Fault Tolerance   | The client must handle connection failures or unexpected shutdowns gracefully.             |
| SRS-CLIENT-008 | Usability         | Command-line arguments must allow enabling verbose logging for debugging purposes.         |
| SRS-CLIENT-009 | Usability         | Logs must include detailed status updates for debugging.                                   |

## 3. Interfaces and Dependencies

### Interfaces:

- **External Interfaces:**
  - gRPC-based communication for interacting with the distributed network.
  - CSV file output for storing predicted target positions.

### Dependencies:
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `grpc` for network communication.
  - `numpy` for mathematical operations.
  - `time`for scheduling.
  - `datetime` for timestamping.
- **Data Files:**
  - CSV files containing predicted target positions.
- **Protobuf Files:**
  - Protobuf definitions in `network.proto` for gRPC stub interface.
